# Polygamy

- How could it ever be ok for Joseph to be commanded by the Lord to marry other women then boldly lie about it to Emma?

- After she learned of his extra-marital liasons, why did Joseph promise Emma that he would take no more wives, then marry more behind her back? I struggle to reconcile the divine origin of polygamy with this dishonesty.

- Would the Lord ever tell a girl she should marry Joseph or else Joseph and she would be cut down by an angel with a flaming sword?

- How is it ok to send a married man on a mission, then after he is gone, approach his wife and tell her that she needs to marry Joseph?

- How is it ok for Joseph Smith to marry 14 year old girls? This is Warren Jeffs territory.

- There is no evidence that Joseph's sexual liason with his 16 year old maid Fanny Alger was anything other than an affair. Even though she is listed as his first plural wife by the modern church, there is no record that she was sealed to Joseph or that she had anything to do with Mormonism after Emma kicked her our of the house when she found them copulating in their barn. This occurred 3 years before Joseph took his first official plural wife.

# Joseph as Translator

- Why did Joseph copy passages from Isaiah from the King James version of the Bible? (Errors only found in the KJV translation are also propagated in the Book of Mormon).

- If Joseph did copy Isaiah from the KJV, why did he change certain things as if to indicate they were translated from a different source?

- Why did Joseph pretend to translate the Egyptian hieroglyphs found in the Abraham facsimiles?

- Why did Joseph pretend to translate the kinderhook plates saying they contained a record of the seed of Ham when they were a nonsensical forgery?

- Why does the modern church try to dismiss the kinderhook scandal by saying the record is suspect because it came from the journal of William Clayton?! William Clayton's journals were used to complete the official church history and were often the source for sections in our official canonized Doctrine and Covenants. His calling was literally to maintain sacred records in Nauvoo. This feels dishonest.

- Why did Joseph claim to revise the Bible when much of his revisions were simply a copy of XXXX's biblical commentary?

- Why are so many phrases from the Book of Mormon uncannily similar to "The Late War", a book commonly used to teach kids to read in New York when Joseph was a boy?

- It seems improbable to me that over 2 million people were killed in one book of mormon battle with hand to hand combat. The sheer logistics are staggering. That's almost double the total soldiers than America has lost in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWI, WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam war and all other foreign armed conflict combined!

- If this and many other conflicts occurred, why have we not found a single sword, shield, or other artifact traceable to this civilization.

# Experiences with the Supernatural

- Why do the early records of Joseph's visits with "Moroni" refer to him as "Nephi"?

- Why do the various accounts Joseph gave of the first vision vary so drastically one from another?

- I find it troubling that Joseph claimed to use his gift as a seer to see that the moon was inhabited by 6 foot tall 1000 year old Quakers. Quote : "This is the description of them as given by Joseph the Seer, and he could â€˜See' whatever he asked the Father in the name of Jesus to see."

- Why are there no records of the priesthood restoration until 5 years after the event supposedly occurred? Even believing historian Richard Bushman comments, "the late appearance of these accounts raises the possibility of later fabrication"
