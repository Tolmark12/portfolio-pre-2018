    .overview.pure-u-14-24 This project is meant to introduce students to various designers, architects and design firms while providing them an opportunity to work in a multi-disciplinary team. Each four person team, composed of industrial and graphic designers, selected a designer from a list. They were then to construct a 7-inch cube in the formal language of that designer. Furthermore, they were to create a tri-fold brochure about their designer; again in the stylistic language of that designer. This challenged students to identify and apply the formal qualities of their designerâ€™s work across two different mediums. It also allowed them to work in a group as a specialist, thus avoiding the role confusion suffered by many collaborative groups which are entirely composed of individuals from only one discipline.
