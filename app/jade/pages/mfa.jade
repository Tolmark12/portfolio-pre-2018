    .overview.pure-u-5-12 The idea for my master's thesis began out of frustration. As I worked on large interactive projects where high complexity required talented individuals from many different fields, I found that design was often relegated to the final stages of the process. It became evident that designers were usually viewed as frosting specialists whose job was to pick the fonts and apply gradients after the real work had been completed by developers. Very few seemed to grasp the value design could bring. Therefore, I wrote this thesis to share the purpose of design to developers, clients and project managers; I then designed the book so the casual reader could skim and still walk away with a clearer understanding of the value of design.
